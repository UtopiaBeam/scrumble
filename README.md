# Scrumble

Scrumble is my personal project to manage a scrum powered by [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) + [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/). It is heavily inspired by [Trello](https://trello.com/) and [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira). The main purpose of this project is to create an easy-to-use scrum management tool for myself, but contribution is very welcomed.
